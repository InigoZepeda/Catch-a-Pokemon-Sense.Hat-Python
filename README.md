# Catch-a-Pokemon-Sense.Hat-Python
  Hey!! This repository is about a game called Catch-A-Pokemon, made in the trinket . io website, using the Sense Hat Emulator, with the Python language, and the Pygame library.
  The basic idea of the game is that one (the player) is trying to catch Pokemons, and every attempt of trying to catch one is randomized. Each attempt will firstly show you the Pokemon you tried to catch (drawn on the Sense Hat Emulator), and how far away it is from you (4 distances: Really far away (green), far away (yellow), close (orange), really close (red) (Pokemon catch)). There are 7 different types of Pokemons you can catch (Pikachu, Squirtle, Gengar, Eevee, Mewtwo, Snorlax, Grookey). 
  
  
Play time!
  
In order to get the game started, you need to head to: trinket.io/sense-hat. Delete all of the code from the website, and replace it with the code on this repository (game.py). Be sure that the code is exactly as the one uploaded to this website. Press "Run" on the website in order to initialize the game. Since the website is a bit laggy sometimes, be sure to click on the Sense Hat machine if the game is not running, this will refresh the game.


1. Pressing the key #1 will work as an attempt to try and catch a Pokemon. Each time you do this, a Pokemon drawing will appear on the screen, followed by a distance meter which will tell you how close you were to catching the Pokemon.

2. In order to access your Pokemon list, click key #8. This will show you all the Pokemons you have catched. Again, the game can be a bit laggy because of the website, so after each command (key #1, key #8), it is recommended to click on the Sense Hat machine.

3. Enjoy!
